In Terminal, why does it say "android_363f4a1a5eda3513:scripts backup$"

What was the keyboard shortcut so I don't have to retype "Python batchSplice.py"

Can I place "config.py" into batchSplice?

Is the residual also crossfaded?

Where do we select Blacman or other FFT modes?

Why are there duplicates that say "pyc" instead of py?

If there is a module named "soundfile", should we alos have a variable named "soundFile"?

Why are we using soundfile module instead of what they used in SMS-Tools?
