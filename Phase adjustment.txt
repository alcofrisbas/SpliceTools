StartF = Frame number where crossfade starts
EndF = Frame number where crossfade ends
CfL = Crossfade length in frames
SwF = Doesn't matter, except somewhere between StartF and EndF

First deal with Pitch (FreqCons[i,j]):

For each Harmonic j (except not j = 0)
	PitchDiff = FreqCons[EndF,j] - FreqCons[StartF,j]
	For i = 1 to (CfL - 1)
		FreqCons[StartF + i,j] = FreqCons[StartF,j] + PitchDiff * (i / CfL)


Now we deal with Phases:

Hop = How many samples for each step in FFT
HopTime = Hop / SampleRate
FreqPeriod = 1 / Frequency (time, not samples)

Note that the difference in Phase from start of hop to end of hop will be:
(2π * HopTime / FreqPeriod) mod 2π
= (2π * HopTime * Frequency) mod 2π

Preliminary Consonant Phase Corrections:
For each Harmonic j (except not j = 0)
	For i = 0 to (CfL - 1)
		PhaseCons[StartF + i + 1, j] = (PhaseCons[StartF + i,j] + 2π * HopTime * FreqCons[StartF + i,j]) mod 2π

	Now compare PhaseCons[EndF, j] with PhaseVowel[EndF, j]:
	PhaseCorrectionTotal = (PhaseVowel[EndF, j] - PhaseCons[EndF, j]) mod 2π
	PhaseCorrectionIncremental = - PhaseCorrectionTotal / CfL
	For i = 1 to CfL
		PhaseCons[StartF + i, j] = (PhaseCons[StartF + i, j] + PhaseCorrectionIncremental) mod 2π

Now we can safely crossfade
